# ðŸ’¡Example-BI-Developer-Achievements (Coming up)
This repository specifically provides examples of my achievements as a Business Intelligence Developer at Accuity. It should give you a sense of my skillsets, work style, and responsibilities at the firm.

*****Accuity is the first company I joined after my graduate study in Business Analytics and I still work here as of 9/22/24. I took an assessment test for the Business Intelligence (BI) Developer role as a part of the hiring process and got first place on the test. In the test, a sample dataset was given with minimum information about the data. The direction was to show what I could do with the data in 3 days. It was a great opportunity to show my independent and full-step analytical skills. First, I did market research about the industry and the work process specifically related to the data then created the data dictionary, processed the data, and designed KPIs, metrics, and simple models based on the assumptions drawn from the research. As the final analytics result, I delivered the highlights of the analysis results in a Tableau dashboard with different forms of visualizations, providing the results in multi-dimensions.***
