# ðŸ’¡Example-BI-Developer-Achievements
This repository specifically provides examples of my achievements as a Business Intelligence Developer at Accuity. It should give you a sense of my skillsets, work style, and responsibilities at the firm.

**Accuity is the first company I joined after my graduate study in Business Analytics. I took an assessment test for the Business Intelligence (BI) Developer role as a part of the hiring process and got first place for the test. In the test, a sample dataset was given with minimum information about the data. The direction was to show what I could do with the data in 3 days. It was a great opportunity to show my independent and full-step analytical skills. First, I did market research about the industry and the data then created the data dictionary, processed the data, and designed KPIs, metrics, and simple models based on the assumptions drawn from my research. As the final analytics product, I delivered the highlights of the results in Tableau dashboards with different forms of visualizations, transforming the results into multi-dimensions.
